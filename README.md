# Queries Verification on Solana PoC

This is a demo of verifying and parsing [Wormhole Queries](https://wormhole.com/queries/) on Solana.

This project was made with [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/).

Learn more about developing with Queries in [the docs](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/queries/getting-started).

## Accounts

- [GuardianSignatures](programs/solana-world-id-program/src/state/guardian_signatures.rs) stores unverified guardian signatures for subsequent verification. These are created with `post_signatures` in service of verifying a root via Queries and closed when that root is verified with `verify_query` or can be explicitly closed with `close_signatures` by the initial payer.

## Instructions

- [post_signatures](programs/example-queries-solana-verify/src/instructions/post_signatures.rs) posts unverified guardian signatures for verification during `update_root_with_query`.
- [verify_query](programs/example-queries-solana-verify/src/instructions/verify_query.rs) with a Query response and `GuardianSignatures` account, verifies the signatures against an active guardian set and logs the Query response. This is where you would add additional verification relevant to your use case and process the result.
- [close_signatures](programs/example-queries-solana-verify/src/instructions/close_signatures.rs) allows the initial payer to close a `GuardianSignatures` account in case the query was invalid.
